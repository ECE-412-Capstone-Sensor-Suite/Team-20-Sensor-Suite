        data_log = """Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, 
        15 October 1844 â€“ 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, 
        cultural critic, composer, poet, writer, and philologist 
        whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history.
        He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. 
        He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology 
        at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.[44] Nietzsche resigned in 1879 
        due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing 
        in the following decade.[45] In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse 
        and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years 
        in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth FÃ¶rster-Nietzsche. 
        Nietzsche died in 1900.
        Nietzsche's writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, 
        and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony.[47] Prominent elements of his philosophy 
        include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; a genealogical critique of religion 
        and Christian morality and related theory of masterâ€“slave morality;[40][48][i] the aesthetic affirmation of life 
        in response to both the "death of God" and the profound crisis of nihilism;[40] the notion of Apollonian 
        and Dionysian forces; and a characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, 
        collectively understood as the will to power.[49] He also developed influential concepts such as the Ãœbermensch 
        and the doctrine of eternal return.[50][51] In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied 
        with the creative powers of the individual to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of new values 
        and aesthetic health.[43] His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, 
        religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew inspiration from figures such as Socrates, Zoroaster, 
        Arthur Schopenhauer,[23] Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Wagner[23] and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe."""

        data_log = """Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, 
        15 October 1844 â€“ 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, 
        cultural critic, composer, poet, writer, and philologist 
        whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history.
        He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. 
        He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology 
        at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.[44] Nietzsche resigned in 1879 
        due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing 
        in the following decade.[45] In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse 
        and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years 
        in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth FÃ¶rster-Nietzsche. 
        Nietzsche died in 1900.
        Nietzsche's writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, 
        and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony.[47] Prominent elements of his philosophy 
        include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; a genealogical critique of religion 
        and Christian morality and related theory of masterâ€“slave morality;[40][48][i] the aesthetic affirmation of life 
        in response to both the "death of God" and the profound crisis of nihilism;[40] the notion of Apollonian 
        and Dionysian forces; and a characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, 
        collectively understood as the will to power.[49] He also developed influential concepts such as the Ãœbermensch 
        and the doctrine of eternal return.[50][51] In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied 
        with the creative powers of the individual to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of new values 
        and aesthetic health.[43] His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, 
        religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew inspiration from figures such as Socrates, Zoroaster, 
        Arthur Schopenhauer,[23] Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Wagner[23] and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe."""
