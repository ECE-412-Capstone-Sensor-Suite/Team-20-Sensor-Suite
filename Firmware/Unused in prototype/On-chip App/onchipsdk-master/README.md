* [Documentation](https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OCSDK)
* [Discussion](https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/questions)
* [Issue tracking](https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/browse/OCSDK)
 
To use the SDK, you will also need to:
* Obtain a copy of the [IAR toolchain](http://www.iar.com/en/Products/IAR-Embedded-Workbench/ARM/) - the kickstart addition will not work with the OCSDK
* Have a supported [manager and mote](https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OCSDK/Required+Hardware) and optional programming/debugging tools
* Get the library files. The SmartMesh library is **not** included in the On-Chip SDK repository, but is made available 
in your MyAnalog "My Resources" area - you must have a myanalog account, and please submit the 20-digit key (included with kits) and your full contact information (the email must match your myanalog account) to dustsoftware@analog.com to start the process.
* Read the OCSDK [Documentation](https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OCSDK) and the API documentation in the /doc folder
